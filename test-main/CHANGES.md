The BitSlow Marketplace application started as a basic prototype, but I transformed it into a fully functional system that includes secure user authentication, a dynamic transaction dashboard, and an interactive BitSlow coin marketplace. Initially, the backend was minimal, only seeding the database and providing basic endpoints for retrieving transaction data. Over time, I expanded it by adding several new API endpoints, including /api/register, /api/login, /api/profile, /api/coins, /api/buy, /api/generate-coin, and /api/coin-history. These changes were essential to support critical features such as secure user registration and login, fetching detailed user profile data, and handling complex marketplace operations. I also improved the seeding logic to create a richer data environment, adjusting parameters for clients, coins, and transactions to ensure the system could realistically support these new features.

On the frontend, I made significant modifications to replace the simple data-fetching approach with a more dynamic and responsive system. In App.tsx, I integrated a custom authentication hook (useAuth) that manages the user's session by storing and retrieving data from localStorage, allowing seamless transitions between logged-in and logged-out states. I also enhanced the transaction dashboard by implementing advanced filtering and pagination. Users can now filter transactions by date range, value range, buyer name, and seller name, and navigate through pages of transactions, greatly improving the dashboard’s usability. These updates ensure that the frontend efficiently interacts with the backend by dynamically building query strings and sending API requests based on user actions.

To support secure authentication, I introduced new files such as LogIn.tsx and SignUp.tsx. LogIn.tsx provides a login form that validates user credentials against the /api/login endpoint, while SignUp.tsx offers a registration form that interacts with the /api/register endpoint. Both components include input validation and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. Additionally, I created useAuth.ts to centralize authentication logic, ensuring that session information is consistently available across the application. These components play a crucial role in managing the authentication flow and securing sensitive operations like purchasing or generating coins.

Beyond authentication, I also built dedicated modules for the marketplace and user profile. MarketPlace.tsx serves as the entry point for the BitSlow marketplace, displaying available coins, facilitating purchases, and enabling users to generate new coins. Similarly, Profile.tsx provides users with a personalized interface to view their total transactions, coins owned, and overall financial status.

API requests are the core of the application’s functionality. On the server side, I used dynamic routing in index.tsx to match incoming requests to the appropriate handlers. Each endpoint validates input data, constructs SQL queries dynamically to support pagination and filtering, and interacts with the SQLite database. For example, when a user logs in, the /api/login endpoint verifies the provided password against the stored hashed password and returns the user’s credentials upon success. Likewise, the /api/transactions endpoint accepts query parameters for filtering and paginating data, ensuring that the frontend receives only the necessary information.

On the client side, components such as App.tsx, MarketPlace.tsx, and Profile.tsx use the fetch API to send GET and POST requests to these endpoints. The frontend builds query strings based on user interactions—such as applying filters or navigating through pages—and updates React state with the response data, ensuring the UI always reflects the latest backend information. I also incorporated robust error handling; if a request fails, the application displays clear error messages to inform the user. Before executing sensitive operations like buying or generating coins, the system checks the user’s authentication state via the useAuth hook, ensuring all data-modifying actions are securely authenticated.

Every change I made to the BitSlow Marketplace application was driven by the goal of creating a secure, and user-friendly system. The backend enhancements ensure reliable data processing and validation, while the frontend modifications and new components provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

Most Challenging Part:

Integrating the frontend and backend was quite challenging. Debugging asynchronous operations, ensuring that the API endpoints communicated correctly with the React components, and handling edge cases in filtering and pagination required careful planning and troubleshooting.

What I Enjoyed Implementing:

I really enjoyed building the marketplace. Designing the dynamic user interface with Tailwind CSS and watching the transactions and coins update in real time was very satisfying. I particularly liked working with the string manipulations and data formatting between different UI elements—it gave me a deeper insight into how the user interface communicates with the underlying data. This project provided me with a great opportunity to see how everything is combined together, allowing me to understand more clearly how frontend and backend concepts work in harmony.

Suggestions for Improvement:

I suggest enhancing error handling across both layers of the application and incorporating automated tests for critical functionalities. Additionally, refactoring the code for better modularity and performance—especially in managing state and data fetching—would improve maintainability. Overall, this project offered a valuable hands-on experience in integrating and combining various technologies to build a complete, cohesive application.
